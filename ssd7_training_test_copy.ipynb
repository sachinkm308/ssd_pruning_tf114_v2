    "This tutorial explains how to train an SSD7 on the Udacity road traffic datasets, and just generally how to use this SSD implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disclaimer about SSD7:\n",
    "As you will see below, training SSD7 on the aforementioned datasets yields alright results, but I'd like to emphasize that SSD7 is not a carefully optimized network architecture. The idea was just to build a low-complexity network that is fast (roughly 127 FPS or more than 3 times as fast as SSD300 on a GTX 1070) for testing purposes. Would slightly different anchor box scaling factors or a slightly different number of filters in individual convolution layers make SSD7 significantly better at similar complexity? I don't know, I haven't tried."

    "## 1. Set the model configuration parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below sets a number of parameters that define the model configuration. The parameters set here are being used both by the `build_model()` function that builds the model as well as further down by the constructor for the `SSDInputEncoder` object that is needed to to match ground truth and anchor boxes during the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are just some comments on a few of the parameters, read the documentation for more details:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set the height, width, and number of color channels to whatever you want the model to accept as image input. If your input images have a different size than you define as the model input here, or if your images have non-uniform size, then you must use the data generator's image transformations (resizing and/or cropping) so that your images end up having the required input size before they are fed to the model. to convert your images to the model input size during training. The SSD300 training tutorial uses the same image pre-processing and data augmentation as the original Caffe implementation, so take a look at that to see one possibility of how to deal with non-uniform-size images.\n",
    "* The number of classes is the number of positive classes in your dataset, e.g. 20 for Pascal VOC or 80 for MS COCO. Class ID 0 must always be reserved for the background class, i.e. your positive classes must have positive integers as their IDs in your dataset.\n",
    "* The `mode` argument in the `build_model()` function determines whether the model will be built with or without a `DecodeDetections` layer as its last layer. In 'training' mode, the model outputs the raw prediction tensor, while in 'inference' and 'inference_fast' modes, the raw predictions are being decoded into absolute coordinates and filtered via confidence thresholding, non-maximum suppression, and top-k filtering. The difference between latter two modes is that 'inference' uses the decoding procedure of the original Caffe implementation, while 'inference_fast' uses a faster, but possibly less accurate decoding procedure.\n",
    "* The reason why the list of scaling factors has 5 elements even though there are only 4 predictor layers in tSSD7 is that the last scaling factor is used for the second aspect-ratio-1 box of the last predictor layer. Refer to the documentation for details.\n",
    "* `build_model()` and `SSDInputEncoder` have two arguments for the anchor box aspect ratios: `aspect_ratios_global` and `aspect_ratios_per_layer`. You can use either of the two, you don't need to set both. If you use `aspect_ratios_global`, then you pass one list of aspect ratios and these aspect ratios will be used for all predictor layers. Every aspect ratio you want to include must be listed once and only once. If you use `aspect_ratios_per_layer`, then you pass a nested list containing lists of aspect ratios for each individual predictor layer. This is what the SSD300 training tutorial does. It's your design choice whether all predictor layers should use the same aspect ratios or whether you think that for your dataset, certain aspect ratios are only necessary for some predictor layers but not for others. Of course more aspect ratios means more predicted boxes, which in turn means increased computational complexity.\n",
    "* If `two_boxes_for_ar1 == True`, then each predictor layer will predict two boxes with aspect ratio one, one a bit smaller, the other one a bit larger.\n",
    "* If `clip_boxes == True`, then the anchor boxes will be clipped so that they lie entirely within the image boundaries. It is recommended not to clip the boxes. The anchor boxes form the reference frame for the localization prediction. This reference frame should be the same at every spatial position.\n",
    "* In the matching process during the training, the anchor box offsets are being divided by the variances. Leaving them at 1.0 for each of the four box coordinates means that they have no effect. Setting them to less than 1.0 spreads the imagined anchor box offset distribution for the respective box coordinate.\n",
    "* `normalize_coords` converts all coordinates from absolute coordinate to coordinates that are relative to the image height and width. This setting has no effect on the outcome of the training."

    "\n",
    "The code cells below set up data generators for the training and validation datasets to train the model. You will have to set the file paths to your dataset. Depending on the annotations format of your dataset, you might also have to switch from the CSV parser to the XML or JSON parser, or you might have to write a new parser method in the `DataGenerator` class that can handle whatever format your annotations are in. The [README](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras/blob/master/README.md) of this repository provides a summary of the design of the `DataGenerator`, which should help you in case you need to write a new parser or adapt one of the existing parsers to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the generator provides two options to speed up the training. By default, it loads the individual images for a batch from disk. This has two disadvantages. First, for compressed image formats like JPG, this is a huge computational waste, because every image needs to be decompressed again and again every time it is being loaded. Second, the images on disk are likely not stored in a contiguous block of memory, which may also slow down the loading process. The first option that `DataGenerator` provides to deal with this is to load the entire dataset into memory, which reduces the access time for any image to a negligible amount, but of course this is only an option if you have enough free memory to hold the whole dataset. As a second option, `DataGenerator` provides the possibility to convert the dataset into a single HDF5 file. This HDF5 file stores the images as uncompressed arrays in a contiguous block of memory, which dramatically speeds up the loading time. It's not as good as having the images in memory, but it's a lot better than the default option of loading them from their compressed JPG state every time they are needed. Of course such an HDF5 dataset may require significantly more disk space than the compressed images. You can later load these HDF5 datasets directly in the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set the batch size to to your preference and to what your GPU memory allows, it's not the most important hyperparameter. The Caffe implementation uses a batch size of 32, but smaller batch sizes work fine, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DataGenerator` itself is fairly generic. I doesn't contain any data augmentation or bounding box encoding logic. Instead, you pass a list of image transformations and an encoder for the bounding boxes in the `transformations` and `label_encoder` arguments of the data generator's `generate()` method, and the data generator will then apply those given transformations and the encoding to the data. Everything here is preset already, but if you'd like to learn more about the data generator and its data augmentation capabilities, take a look at the detailed tutorial in [this](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/data_generator_object_detection_2d) repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image processing chain defined further down in the object named `data_augmentation_chain` is just one possibility of what a data augmentation pipeline for unform-size images could look like. Feel free to put together other image processing chains, you can use the `DataAugmentationConstantInputSize` class as a template. Or you could use the original SSD data augmentation pipeline by instantiting an `SSDDataAugmentation` object and passing that to the generator instead. This procedure is not exactly efficient, but it evidently produces good results on multiple datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "An `SSDInputEncoder` object, `ssd_input_encoder`, is passed to both the training and validation generators. As explained above, it matches the ground truth labels to the model's anchor boxes and encodes the box coordinates into the format that the model needs."

    "The example setup below was used to train SSD7 on two road traffic datasets released by [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/annotations) with around 20,000 images in total and 5 object classes (car, truck, pedestrian, bicyclist, traffic light), although the vast majority of the objects are cars. The original datasets have a constant image size of 1200x1920 RGB. I consolidated the two datasets, removed a few bad samples (although there are probably many more), and resized the images to 300x480 RGB, i.e. to one sixteenth of the original image size. In case you'd like to train a model on the same dataset, you can download the consolidated and resized dataset I used [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tfBFavijh4UTG4cGqIKwhcklLXUDuY0D) (about 900 MB)."

    "1. Always load the full model if you can, rather than building a new model and loading previously saved weights into it. Optimizers like SGD or Adam keep running averages of past gradient moments internally. If you always save and load full models when resuming a training, then the state of the optimizer is maintained and the training picks up exactly where it left off. If you build a new model and load weights into it, the optimizer is being initialized from scratch, which, especially in the case of Adam, leads to small but unnecessary setbacks every time you resume the training with previously saved weights.\n",
    "2. You should tell `fit_generator()` which epoch to start from, otherwise it will start with epoch 0 every time you resume the training. Set `initial_epoch` to be the next epoch of your training. Note that this parameter is zero-based, i.e. the first epoch is epoch 0. If you had trained for 10 epochs previously and now you'd want to resume the training from there, you'd set `initial_epoch = 10` (since epoch 10 is the eleventh epoch). Furthermore, set `final_epoch` to the last epoch you want to run. To stick with the previous example, if you had trained for 10 epochs previously and now you'd want to train for another 10 epochs, you'd set `initial_epoch = 10` and `final_epoch = 20`.\n",

Those settings are for precision-recall scoring purposes though. In order to get some usable final predictions, we'll set the confidence threshold much higher, e.g. to 0.5, since we're only interested in the very confident predictions."
